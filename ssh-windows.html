<h1>Generating SSH keys on Windows 10</h1>

1) Launching GitBash
  a) Open `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe`
  b) Create the SSH directory in your root folder
    `mkdir .ssh`
    It will look something like this:
     `C:\Users\<profile name>\.ssh`
  c) Generate the keys
    `ssh-keygen.exe`
  d) When prompted for a password, type in a password or leave blank and press enter to complete the process
  e) The output will look similar to the one shown below:
  Your identification has been saved in C:\Users\<profile name>/.ssh/id_rsa.
  Your public key has been saved in C:\Users\<profile name>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
  The key fingerprint is:
  SHA256<random string> <...>@<computer name>
  The key's randomart image is: 
  +---[RSA 2048]----+
 |*= =+.           |
 |O*=.B            |
 |+*o* +           |
 |o +o.  .         |
